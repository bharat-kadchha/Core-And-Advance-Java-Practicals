its is mainly use for testing purpose.it will check expression or line of code before running.
if expression is false then JVM throw Assertion error.
its default disable.we can enable it.

ENABLE--java -ea Class_name DISABLE--java -da Class_name

 why it is use ?

		 to make sure over condition is logically true.
		 check object state.
		 to check unreachable code
		 at runtime assert will disable.

		 assertion and exception handling are different.
