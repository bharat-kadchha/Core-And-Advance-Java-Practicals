# jAVA DESIGN PATTERN
### this directory contains the concepts of java design patterns. Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced `object-oriented` software developers.

## Design Pattern :
- Design patterns are `solutions` to general problems that software developers faced during `software` development.
- Design patterns not only bring standardization to your code but also ensure that your code follows good programming principles, such as `coupling` and `cohesion`.
- It's one type of template for how to solve a problem. also, it has many advantages to use it.


 - **Advantages** :
  
    - Designing smart and `flexible` codes as per project requirements
    - Unwanted codes and problems can be `easily identified` and changed 
    - Common design patterns can be improved over time, making them more `robust` than ad-hoc designs
    - Provide `transparency` to the design of an application.
    - Provide the solutions that help to define the `system architecture`

    | Pattern             | Description | Examples |
    | ------------------- | ----------- | -------- |
    | Creational Patterns |  These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using a new operator. This gives the program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.           |     Factory Pattern, Abstract Factory Pattern, Singleton Pattern, Prototype Pattern, Builder Pattern     |
    | Structural Patterns |   These design patterns concern class and object composition. The concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities       |    Adapter Pattern, Bridge Pattern, Composite Pattern, Decorator Pattern, Facade Pattern, Proxy Pattern      |
    | Behavioral Patterns |     These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.|     Chain Of Responsibility Pattern, Mediator Pattern, Template Pattern     |
    | J2EE Patterns       |      These design patterns are specifically concerned with the presentation tier. These patterns are identified by Sun Java Center.       |     MVC, DAO Pattern, Service Locator Pattern, etc     |

 - here, I have used `java-8`. so you have to use the `java-8` or `java-8+` version of JDK.

# SUPPORT
I was inspired to learn java language from **prof Ashutosh Abhangi**, who takes java as a subject of a Bachelor's degree, and he teaches theory with practical knowledge and introduces to a student with new technology.
