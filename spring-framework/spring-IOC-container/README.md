# SPRING BASIC

## these projects contain core concepts of spring. 

   ### what you are learing from following projects as below.
   
   - SpringHelloWorld :
  
      - This is first spring project that print *hello world* .
      - Simplly,create Bean and inject class dependency using setter method. 
      - All the context of application writedown in xml file called `applicationContext.xml`. we can modified it.

   - SpringCouplingTypeDemo :
      
     - Basically, there are two type of codeing style `Tight Coupling` and `Loose Coupling`.
     1. **Tight Coupling** :
         - Tight coupling means classes and objects are *dependent* on one another. 
         - Tight coupling is usually not good because it reduces the flexibility and re-usability of the code.
       
     2. **Loose Coupling** :
         - Loose coupling means classes and objects are *independent* on one another.
         - Loose coupling is usally reducing the dependencies of a class that uses the different class directly.
