# SPRING BASIC

## This directory contains core concepts of spring. 

   ### what you are learning from the following projects.
   
   - SpringHelloWorld :
  
      - This is the first spring project that prints *hello world*.
      - Simply, create Bean and inject class dependency using the setter method. 
      - All the context of the application writedown in an XML file called `applicationContext.xml`. we can modify it.

   - SpringCouplingTypeDemo :
      
     - Basically, there is two types of coding style `Tight Coupling` and `Loose Coupling`.
     1. **Tight Coupling** :
         - Tight coupling means classes and objects are *dependent* on one another. 
         - Tight coupling is usually not good because it reduces the flexibility and re-usability of the code.
       
     2. **Loose Coupling** :
         - Loose coupling means classes and objects are *independent* of one another.
         - Loose coupling is usually reducing the dependencies of a class that uses the different classes directly.
