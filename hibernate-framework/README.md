# HIBERNATE FRAMEWORK
### this directory for one of the famous ORM tools of java is **HIBERNATE**. in these you can learn more about hibernate and expanding skills basic to advance with ORM concept.

## INSTRUCTIONS :

   - all are project builds with the help of **MAVEN**. so, you can see the POM.XML file in every project. where you can add your extra dependency.
   - `Project Lombok is plugged with my IDE for the reducing boilerplate code. like getter, setter, or constructor, etc.
   -  you can download the `LOMBOK` java library form : [here](https://projectlombok.org/download)
   - here, I have to use `hibernate 5.4.0 FINAL`. so you have to use that version of hibernate.
   - if you want to learn more about the ORM concept or Hibernate then you visit the official DOC : [hibernate DOC](https://hibernate.org/orm/documentation/5.4/)
   - download for all the dependency from central-repository : [mvnrepository.com](https://mvnrepository.com/)
   - here, in these projects, I have used `java-8`. so you have to use the `java-8` or `java-8+` version of JDK.

## BINARIES REQUIREMENT :
  - download jar file or add a dependency to your POM.XML. 
      1. hibernate-core(5.14)  :  [download](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.hibernatehibernate-core/5.4.0.Final)
